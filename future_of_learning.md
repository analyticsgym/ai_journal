## Notes to future self on using AI as a learning tool.

#### 1. AI tools can create an illusion of "learning"
- are you using GenAI to bench press for you, or treating it like a personal trainer?
- "If you try to shortcut the game, then the game will shortcut you." - Michael Jordan
- learning science suggests new neural pathways form through struggle, feedback, and synthesis
- [Anders Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson) describes the learning process as deliberate practice[1]
- learning tools change and improve over time; the learning process persists

#### 2. Deep understanding of the fundamentals becomes increasingly valuable
- the foundation for independent thinking = deep understanding of the fundamentals in a given domain and across domains (commonality between leading investors, CEOs, elite performers)
- deep understanding of the fundamentals enables first principles thinking and innovation
- do we simply regurgitate what we get from AI and social media, OR are we able to form independent and novel insights?

#### 3. Learning becomes increasingly multi-modal and on-demand, like AI tools 
- imagine AI has the context on what is happening in your personal and professional life 
- before work, AI generates a custom podcast or learning video on X topic you're struggling with at work 
- AI generates a practice scenario on X and coaches on strengths and weaknesses
- AI tests your knowledge via an interview/assessment on X topic
- you add notes/reflections on X topic to a tool that feeds into the AI
- you use the AI to search/synthesize insights across your learning notes/reflections for Y work situation
- after work, AI generates a podcast, audiobook, or Kindle book to assist with Z personal life challenge

- [1] ChatGPT summary of Anders Ericsson's deliberate practice framing:
    - set specific, narrow goals: break complex skills into sub-skills and focus on one targeted improvement at a time
    - stretch beyond comfort: practice at the edge of your ability—real learning requires struggle, not repetition
    - seek clear feedback: use immediate, actionable feedback to guide correction, whether from a coach or self-reflection process
    - iterate relentlessly: try, fail, adjust, and retry—learning happens through corrected mistakes and fast cycles
    - build mental models: develop internal representations that help recognize patterns and guide expert decision-making
    - play the long game: mastery takes sustained effort over months or years; quality of practice beats quantity
