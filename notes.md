### 1. LLMs can create an illusion of learning
- instant access to LLM prompt answers/summaries can create an illusion of learning
- no struggle = no learning
- it's like using the LLM to bench press for you vs treating it like a personal trainer
- learning science suggests new neural pathways form through struggle, feedback, and synthesis
- [Anders Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson) describes the learning process as deliberate practice[1]
- using LLMs to skip mental/learning workouts is not likely to yield high-quality learning outcomes and deep understanding
- "If you try to shortcut the game, then the game will shortcut you." - Michael Jordan
- "The tools for learning are abundant. It’s the desire to learn that’s scarce." - [Naval](https://x.com/naval/status/912222091251871745)

### 2. AI tools are a talent amplifier for advanced knowledge work
- AI tools x 10x engineer = more impact/smarter decisions/increased velocity and vs non-engineer vibe coding (likely to translate across business domains)[2]
- AI tools can take on more of the grunt work, leaving the most strategic/creative work for humans + AI
- lack of talent/skill translates to using AI tools blindly, sub-optimal prompting, and lack of output understanding

### 3. Deep understanding of the fundamentals becomes increasingly valuable
- foundation for thinking independently = deep understanding of the fundamentals in a given domain and across domains (commonality between leading investors, CEOs, elite performers)
- deep understanding of the fundamentals enables first principles thinking and innovation
- do we simply regurgitate what we get from LLMs/social media, OR are we able to form independent and novel insights?

### 4. Learning becomes increasingly multi-modal and on-demand, like AI tools 
- LLM generates a custom podcast or learning video on X topic I'm struggling with at work 
- LLM generates a practice scenario on X and coaches on strengths and weaknesses
- LLM tests my knowledge via an interview on X topic
- I add my notes on X topic to my "learning training data" tool
- I use the LLM to search/synthesize insights across my learning notes for Y work situation
- LLM generates an audiobook or Kindle book I can consume at night to assist with Z personal life challenge

- [1] ChatGPT summary of deliberate practice
    - set specific, narrow goals: break complex skills into sub-skills and focus on one targeted improvement at a time.
    - stretch beyond comfort: practice at the edge of your ability—real learning requires struggle, not repetition.
    - seek clear feedback: use immediate, actionable feedback to guide correction, whether from a coach or self-reflection process.
    - iterate relentlessly: try, fail, adjust, and retry—learning happens through corrected mistakes and fast cycles.
    - build mental models: develop internal representations that help recognize patterns and guide expert decision-making.
    - play the long game: mastery takes sustained effort over months or years; quality of practice beats quantity.
